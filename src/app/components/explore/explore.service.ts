            '<p>Communicating well is always a challenge. But during changing times, it can be even harder. People tend to be less trusting of others and to feel less secure and more stressed when their work environment is changing. All of this can cause communication problems and misunderstandings. Here are some suggestions on positive communication during times of workplace change.</p><p><strong>Communicating with your manager</strong></p><p>Often we don&rsquo;t know how change at work&mdash;a company restructure, a new manager coming in, for example&mdash;will affect our jobs and our lives. So, we worry and may jump to conclusions such as these:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;With the reorganization, I&rsquo;ll have to do more work.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never learn the new procedures.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to do this and my old job.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll have to move to another office.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>The sooner you can find out from your manager how your job will be affected, the easier it will be for you to adapt and help. Your manager may not have all the answers to your questions, but it&rsquo;s important to let your manager know about your concerns.</p><p>Ask for coaching or training if necessary. Even the most capable employees need additional training and help to meet new job demands and learn new systems and procedures.</p><p><strong>Discuss any additional tools or resources you may need in order to meet new or changing work goals.</strong> Ask for the support and tools you need to excel in your job. For example, you might ask your manager to review how to handle new forms or processes.</p><p><strong>Ask for coaching or training if necessary.</strong> Even the most capable employees need additional training and help to meet new job demands and learn new systems and procedures. This does not have to involve an expensive outside training program; maybe your manager can suggest a co-worker with more expertise as a coach.</p><p><strong>Communicating with co-workers</strong></p><p>Good relationships with co-workers can help build trust that will see you through uncertain times.</p><p><strong>Build positive relationships with co-workers.</strong> Get to know people. Pick up the phone to chat. Make time for coffee or lunch with co-workers, even if it&rsquo;s a virtual coffee break by phone or a video chat with someone who works from home.</p><p><strong>Praise a job well done.</strong> When you notice good work, tell your co-worker what a great job he or she did. Even managers appreciate sincere positive feedback.</p><p><strong>Avoid adding to the rumour mill.</strong> Rumours spread quickly during times of change. That&rsquo;s because when things are unclear, people tend to read into the situation and fear the worst. Some of the rumours often heard during times of workplace change include:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to lose our jobs.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;The company&rsquo;s going to be sold.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;The plant&rsquo;s going to close.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re bringing in new management and firing all of us.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Be skeptical about what you hear. Don&rsquo;t communicate about the company or trust information you receive via social media. Nevertheless, you may see troubling news items about your company online. Ask for your manager&rsquo;s help in separating fact from fiction or identifying fake news. Go to your manager or someone reliable who has access to the right information and try to confirm what&rsquo;s true and what isn&rsquo;t. Remember that management may not have all the answers. Sometimes, such as when a company is being sold or acquired, few people may know all the facts.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t communicate about the company or trust information you receive via social media. Nevertheless, you may see troubling news items about your company online. Ask for your manager&rsquo;s help in separating fact from fiction or identifying fake news.</p><p><strong>Resolving communication problems at work</strong></p><p>When the pace at work is hurried and people feel uncertain, we often have shorter fuses. We may become less civil. We can forget to update each other.  Here are some strategies to avoid misunderstandings and strained relationships at work:</p><p><strong>Assume positive intent.</strong> Expect misunderstandings to arise in times of change. Take them for what they often are: miscommunication between well-meaning co-workers, who are trying to do a good job.</p><p><strong>Resolve ongoing problems as soon as you can.</strong> The longer you avoid discussing difficult issues, the harder they may become to fix.</p><p><strong>Pinpoint what the problem is.</strong> Are you frustrated because your new manager has a different style of managing from your old one? Are you stressed because your co-worker isn&rsquo;t doing her share? Identify what&rsquo;s bothering you. Think about it carefully to clarify your concerns.</p><p><strong>Set up a time to talk about the problem.</strong> This should be a planned meeting &mdash; not a quick talk in the hallway. You might say to your co-worker or manager, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to discuss an issue that&rsquo;s worrying me. Could we arrange a time to sit down and talk?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Plan what you&rsquo;re going to say.</strong> You don&rsquo;t want to beat around the bush, but you do want the conversation to stay positive and focused. This is not a time to vent. So, prioritize. Write down what you want to say. Offer solutions and suggestions for fixing the problem. You can practice what you&rsquo;ll say ahead of time.</p><p>Be as specific as you can. Try to talk about the impact of the problem in a business context.</p><p><strong>Make it clear from the start that your goal is to build a strong working relationship.</strong> If you&rsquo;re talking with your manager, you could begin by saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re talking, because I want to solve this problem that&rsquo;s been interfering with my work.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Describe the problem.</strong> Be as specific as you can. Try to talk about the impact of the problem in a business context. For example, if you&rsquo;re not being updated often enough, you may have given customers incorrect or outdated information.</p><p><strong>Try to stay calm, not argumentative.</strong> When you keep cool and calm, you&rsquo;re in control and open to what others are saying.</p><p><strong>Concentrate on being a careful listener.</strong> Careful listening is important whether you are handling a problem with a co-worker, having a discussion with your manager, or talking with a family member or friend. If you have a tendency to interrupt others, overcome it.</p><p><strong>Use direct channels of communication.</strong> If you&rsquo;re angry with a co-worker, talk with her, not with other co-workers behind her back. Try to have important conversations face-to-face rather than by email or voice mail. You might begin the conversation by saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble with what happened yesterday. Is there a time when we can talk?&rdquo; If the problem is bigger than you can handle yourself, your manager or a trusted co-worker might be able to give you valuable feedback.</p><p><strong>If you say something at work that you later regret, follow up with a personal apology.</strong> If you&rsquo;ve you lashed out in frustration at a co-worker, overreacted at a meeting, or criticized someone in front of others, an apology is in order. It&rsquo;s best to offer it privately and in person. It&rsquo;s OK to keep it simple. You might say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I lost my temper yesterday. I didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Speak up if you have a concern.</strong> If a co-worker who is also under stress from workplace change has been rude or impatient, let him know that this bothered you, preferably soon after the event and in private. You might start the conversation by saying, &ldquo;I felt uncomfortable yesterday when you corrected me in front of the customer. Could we agree to let each other know about changes when customers are not present?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Remember to ask for a break if you think you are going to lose your patience or composure.</strong> It&rsquo;s alright to say, &ldquo;I need a break&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need some time to think about this.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>If a difficult situation at work persists, find someone to help you.</strong> You might find confidential help from your company&rsquo;s HR department, employee assistance program (EAP), a knowledgeable co-worker in another part of the organization, or someone outside the organization.</p><p><strong>Turn to your family and friends for support.</strong> We often withdraw during times of crisis and change, when what we should be doing is staying connected with the people we care about and trust. Be open with your partner or spouse about what you&rsquo;re going through. Don&rsquo;t cut yourself off from friends and co-workers who could offer you the support you need. Most people want to help; sometimes they just need to know you would welcome their support.</p>',

            "<p>Uncertainty can be stressful -- whether it arises close to home, such as changes in the organization; or on a larger scale, such as a shift in government, a recession, or another national event.</p><p>During times of change and uncertainty, employees&rsquo; stress levels can make it hard to stay focused on the job. Productivity may suffer as a result. In this article, we offer practical tips for managers on supporting employees and keeping them focused during unsettled times.</p><p><strong>Action steps for managers</strong></p><p>Managers play a key role in setting the emotional climate of the work group. During uncertain times, it&rsquo;s more important than ever to set a positive tone and to create an environment where employees feel supported and committed to their work. Here are action steps you can take to support your staff through times of transition and uncertainty:</p><p><strong>Understand the signs of stress. </strong>According to research reported in <em>Psychology Today</em>, events that are both unpredictable and uncontrollable are the most stressful and have the greatest negative impact on employee well-being. As a manager, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of this and provide support during tumultuous times.</p><p>Learn about the signs of stress and what you can do to help people cope in this quick audio tip for managers: <u>Recognizing Signs of Stress and Overload</u>.</p><p><strong>Remind all employees to take advantage of the stress-management resources available through your organization. </strong>The employee assistance program (EAP) offers stress-management and wellness resources. Make sure employees know how to access the program, and that services are confidential and available any time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p><strong>Make it clear that inclusion and mutual respect are core values in your workplace. </strong>During times of uncertainty, such as when there are political divides, it&rsquo;s especially important for managers to set a tone of respect and inclusion. Send the message that the success of your workplace rests on a diversity of opinions, values, and beliefs.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to all employees shortly after the 2016 U.S. presidential election asking them to &ldquo;move forward together.&rdquo; He wrote, &ldquo;We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together&hellip;Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world&mdash;regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition, Talent Management 360 published this helpful tip shortly after the 2016 U.S. election: &ldquo;Send out a clear message to your employees that everyone&rsquo;s political positions are respected and will continue to be respected in the workplace.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Keep your finger on the emotional pulse of your team.</strong> Employees have a right to hold and, to a certain degree, express their opinions in the workplace. But they do not have a right to harass or belittle others whose opinions differ from theirs. When do political conversations in the workplace cross the line to harassment? And what should managers do when this happens?</p><p>Here are a few simple points: If you hear conversations in which employees are raising their voices, using a disrespectful tone, or coming on too strong or in ways that could alienate others, you need to act.</p><p>What is just plain conversation to one employee could be experienced as a hostile work environment to another.</p><p>Begin by reminding all employees that respect for diversity includes diversity of opinions. If employees do discuss political views, these conversations should always be calm and respectful. If the problem continues, have a private conversation with employees who are making others feel disrespected or threatened. Remind individuals that tone and language can be experienced as hostile by others and need to be changed.</p><p><strong>Provide perspective.</strong> If your organization is going through a major change or if there is a large-scale event that is affecting the people you manage, acknowledge this and provide some perspective. Then listen. Allow people to voice their concerns on the issue. Are they concerned about the future of the organization? About their own employment future? About national events? Something else? Remind employees this is not the first time the organization has been through a significant change. In addition, reemphasize your values and reinforce a positive vision for the future.</p><p><strong>Promote contributions to the common good.</strong> Remind employees that each one of them contributes to the success of the organization and that what they do matters and is valued.</p><p><strong>Bring your team together.</strong> Team bonding is a great way to bring people together and take their minds off stressful events. Look for ways to do things together as a team, even if it's something small, like ordering takeout and having lunch together. A little laughter and lightness can shift the mood to positive and help boost morale. Spending time talking about common interests like pets, sports, or TV shows can go far in helping bridge gaps.</p><p><strong>Create an issues-free zone. </strong>If the change that&rsquo;s affecting morale involves a major political or news event, set aside safe zones at work. Agree, for example, that once employees enter the break room or lunch room, all discussion of politics or news events will cease.</p><p><strong>Encourage gratitude.</strong> Getting employees to think about the positives in their lives and the kindness of co-workers goes a long way toward creating a supportive workplace. Start a gratitude board in your workplace. Or take advantage of rewards and recognition programs your organization offers, and encourage employees to use them to recognize co-workers who are team players, have been helpful, or who go the extra mile.</p><p><strong>Be a source of optimism.</strong> Fear and negative thinking can be contagious as well as distracting. As a manager, be truthful and realistic, but balance this with hope.</p><p><strong>Remind employees that the EAP is available to provide support during this time and any time. </strong>Trained EAP professionals are available to provide guidance and support to help employees deal with worry, stress, and anxiety.</p><p>If you or your employees are experiencing stress or are distracted due to organizational or national events, recognize that this is a real concern that can have a negative impact on the workplace.</p><p>Carrying out &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; may not be enough. Managers will need to reinforce workplace values, highlight benefits and wellness offerings, and make the extra effort to show employees that they are supported, valued, and heard.</p>",

            '<p>Whether they are common or rare, infectious diseases may affect your business, workforce, and the people you manage. With the recent outbreak of <u>COVID-19</u> (commonly known as Coronavirus) there is growing concern about the spread of infectious diseases in the workplace.</p><p>This article provides a brief overview for managers with best practices on how to communicate and manage employee concerns, whatever the nature of the infectious disease. </p><p><strong>What is an infectious disease?</strong></p><p>Infectious diseases are illnesses caused by germs (such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi) that can make you sick if they get into your body and multiply. While not all diseases are spread from person to person, those that are are classed as contagious (or "communicable"). These may be transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes or has contact with blood or sexual fluids of another person, or when a person touches an object an infected person has used, such as a doorknob or computer mouse.</p><p>Some infectious diseases can be transmitted to people from insects or animals but cannot spread from person to person. Fears about infectious diseases sometimes result from people\'s mistaken beliefs that they can "catch" illnesses that are not contagious. </p><p><strong>Best practices for managers</strong></p><p><strong>Share accurate and up-to-date information.</strong><em> </em>If an infectious disease is causing concern in your workplace, sharing accurate information about the disease is the first step toward helping to manage anxieties in the workplace.</p><p><strong>Offer reassurance and help people stay focused.</strong></p><p><strong>Make clear that your organization takes health and safety very seriously and will take appropriate steps to protect employees. </strong>If your employees normally travel to a country where wide-spread infection has been reported, stay mindful of updates from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html">Health Canada</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization.</p><p><strong>Describe the steps your organization is taking to protect employees, customers, and the public.</strong></p><p><strong>If an outbreak of an infectious disease occurs in your community, give your team information about how your organization and department plan to keep the business running smoothly.</strong><em> </em>Explain what human resources (HR) policies are in place, what type of medical leave and flexible work options exist, and what pay and benefits will be available. Try to develop procedures that will allow key business tasks to be delegated to others or done remotely if people get sick.</p><p><strong>Help people to stay focused on their work and maintain normal routines.</strong></p><p><strong>Encourage any employees who shows signs of stress or anxiety to contact the assistance program.</strong> The program offers support and resources for many personal and work-related issues.</p><p><strong>What to do if an employee has infectious disease-related concerns</strong></p><p>If one of your team is worried that they may have been exposed to an infectious disease, speak to your human resources (HR) department about issues such as: <br />  </p><ul><li>how to protect the privacy of an employee who has or has had an infectious disease if others ask about the illness</li><li>what leave or flexible work options are available to someone who has had or has been exposed to an infectious disease</li><li>when an employee may return to work after developing an infectious disease or traveling to a country where the employee may have been exposed to one</li><li>how to avoid discriminating against or engaging in potentially unfair treatment of someone who has or has had an infectious disease</li><li>what to do if someone refuses to come to work for fear of being infected with a highly contagious disease. The employee\'s refusal may be protected under the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/rights-workplace.html">Canada Labour Code</a>.</li></ul><p>Maintaining good communication with employees, HR, and senior leaders is key to helping your team stay calm, focused, and productive when people have worries or fears about infectious diseases. </p>',

            "<p>One thing that makes telework so attractive and convenient for many people is the flexibility. However, without a clear difference between work and non-work time, some teleworkers allow work to creep into the time that should be reserved for relaxation, family, and other personal needs. On the flipside, some teleworkers find that they have trouble keeping their personal lives from interfering with their work and affecting their work performance. <br /> <br /> Creating and maintaining effective boundaries between work and the rest of life will be an ongoing challenge for you as you manage a telework schedule. </p><p><strong>Communication and work-life boundaries</strong></p><p>One of the most difficult aspects of telework is learning how to establish boundaries and then communicating them to co-workers and your manager in a positive way. Here are some ways to do that: </p><ul><li><em>Know your manager's expectations</em>. Talk with your manager regularly about work expectations and know what is needed in terms of work output. Whether you're already teleworking and want to adjust your schedule for better balance or are just getting started, up-to-date information about your team's goals and your manager's expectations are essential. Set up a regular meeting with your manager to ensure that you stay current with team needs.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Determine when you'll be \"on duty\" and when you'll be \"off duty.\" </em>Take the time to analyze your schedule to determine when your manager, team, and customers need to interact with you the most. When should your workday start and when should it end? Is it important for weekends to be off duty? Will there be times when you're not working but are available for urgent questions? If you have the flexibility to take breaks from work during \"normal\" work hours, for example, to go to the gym at lunch a couple of times a week, how will you shift your workday to make up that time?</li></ul><ul><li><em>Talk with your manager about your weekly schedule. </em>Prepare a draft of how you would like to set up or adjust your schedule and discuss it with your manager. Negotiate a plan that allows you time to recharge and come back to work energized. Reassure your manager that you are still committed to your job and that you, of course, expect to flex your schedule like the rest of the team when there is a work crunch.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Let co-workers or clients know when you will be available</em>. A regularly updated voicemail message is even more essential when you work from home. An example would be a voice message that says, \"Hi, you've reached Mary. I am in the office today, but I will not be available to return calls until 11:30 a.m. If you need immediate assistance, please call Account Services at 555-624-6475.\" This lets people know that you're there; you're just not available at the moment they called. You could also use an electronic calendar that others may access, send out a weekly schedule, or issue email reminders about when you'll be \"out of the office.\"</li></ul><ul><li><em>Talk about and agree on some ground rules with managers and co-workers. </em>These could include expectations about how quickly you will respond to email and voicemail, how frequently you will communicate with managers and co-workers to update them on your progress on shared work, and how to contact you in case of urgent work issues. Agree on these ground rules with your manager and co-workers -- and possibly your clients -- so you all have the same understanding of when you will be available, how quickly you will respond to different kinds of messages, and whether rules apply in urgent situations.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Use technology wisely. </em>Use voicemail and email to your advantage. As long as co-workers and clients feel sure that you will respond in a timely manner, you can decide to allow yourself blocks of uninterrupted time to focus on important work. You might come up with a special signal as a way of alerting you to an especially urgent request. Sometimes it can seem like emails, voicemails, texts, and instant messages are controlling your life, but if you can make a conscious effort to use these technologies wisely, they will work <em>for </em>you.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Staying focused</strong></p><p>You may want to talk with fellow co-workers and friends who telework, as they may have tips. Also, there are a number of good resources including the website for TelCoa (<a href=\"http://www.telecommute.org/\"><em>http://www.telecommute.org</em></a>), an organization that promotes telework and telecommuting, and Michael Dziak's book, <em>Telecommuting Success: A Practical Guide for Staying in the Loop While Working Away from the Office</em>. Here are some suggestions to help you stay focused in your home office: <br /> <em>Establish a workday routine. </em>Many teleworkers find that setting and sticking to a regular routine is helpful for maintaining focus. You may want to establish a schedule that's similar to the one you had when you worked in an office. Begin and end work at the same time each day and take regular, scheduled breaks.</p><ul><li><em>Avoid multitasking. </em>Don't try to get the laundry done or prepare dinner while also working on work tasks that require focus. Instead, take breaks from work to do other things if you need to. Many employees who work from home spend more concentrated time working on computers than they would in the office. Taking regular breaks, like getting up to stretch or take a walk, can actually increase efficiency and reduce errors.</li><li><em>Talk with family members about minimizing distractions. </em>Make sure that all members of your family understand and respect the fact that even though you're home, you're working. You may want to set some guidelines, like agreeing that you're only to be disturbed if there's an emergency or determining who will answer the door or phone when you're working.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Look at your home office. </em>Is there enough room for all of the things you need? Do you have the right equipment? Is it physically separated from the activity of your home? Is it quiet enough for you to be able to concentrate? Is your office ergonomically correct? Any of these things can affect your ability to concentrate. Your employer may have guidelines and even consultants to help you with this.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Get organized. </em>At some point, you may start work on a project and realize that you've left an important file in the office. If this happens to you frequently, you may need to come up with better solutions to avoid having to deal with missing materials. Make lists of all the things you need, including files, equipment, and supplies, and think about what you'll need for specific projects. When you have everything you need at hand, you'll find it easier to focus on your work.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Managing the temptation to overwork</strong></p><p>Once new teleworkers master the basics and solve the problems of distractions and focus, the opposite problem -- overwork -- often sets in. There are many reasons why teleworkers overwork when they work outside of the office, including the following: </p><ul><li>fear of being seen as less productive or less accessible than in-office workers</li></ul><ul><li>unclear communication that creates rework</li></ul><ul><li>manager or co-worker expectations</li></ul><ul><li>access to work during \"off hours\"</li></ul><ul><li>a lack of routine that signifies the regular beginning and end of a workday</li></ul><ul><li>losing track of time in the absence of office routines</li></ul><p><br /> If you're not sure whether you're maintaining a healthy balance between work and life, ask yourself some of the following questions: </p><ul><li>Do I worry that I'm not spending enough time with friends or family because of work?</li></ul><ul><li>Do friends and family complain that I'm always working?</li></ul><ul><li>Do I often find myself working late at night or early in the morning (or beyond my \"normal\" work hours) when there isn't a work emergency?</li></ul><ul><li>Do I ever go into my home office to do \"one last thing\" and end up working for several more hours on work that I could do the next day?</li></ul><ul><li>Do I regularly work on weekends?</li></ul><ul><li>Do others (my manager, co-workers, customers) expect to be able to reach me outside regular business hours?</li></ul><ul><li>Do I work when I'm at home or on vacation because my office is so accessible?</li></ul><p><br /> If you are having trouble turning work off, it's important to come up with a plan to create and maintain a separation between your home and your work. You can do that by establishing schedules, rules, and routines. <br />  </p><p><strong>Maintaining boundaries</strong></p><p>The best way to maintain the boundaries you've set is to remain committed and firm. It's easy to let things slide by working a little later than normal \"just this once\" or answering calls or emails during your off-duty time. Here are some tips for maintaining boundaries between work and the rest of your life: </p><ul><li><em>Create signals that indicate to family members or others in your home when you are working and when you're not</em>. Some people close their office door when they are working as a signal to family members that they aren't to be disturbed. Others may post a schedule in a common area or talk to family members about the coming workday.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Create as much separation between work and home as you can. </em>Have a dedicated workspace in which you only do work. If possible, make it an area that's away from the common areas of your home. Install a separate phone line for work calls that you can turn off in the rest of your home after work, and if you have an office door, close it when you are not working so you can't easily hear the phone or see your computer.</li></ul><ul><li><em>Take scheduled breaks. </em>Just because you're at home doesn't mean that you shouldn't stop for lunch or a break; leave your work area and eat in another part of your house or go for a walk.</li></ul><p><sub>Edited by Jennifer J.

That will help everyone react positively and proactively when the next challenge arises.</li></ul><p><strong>Acknowledge and show that you value people's personal responsibilities.</strong></p><ul><li>Make yourself aware of your organization's work-life programs and encourage employees to take advantage of these. Be sure all employees know about the many resources available through the program that provided this publication, and know how to contact the program. </li><li>Demonstrate that you value people's work-life responsibilities by including team members' important personal commitments into the team's planning calendar—graduations, religious holidays, other important occasions—so that wherever possible, these dates don't conflict with team meetings or project plans.</li><li>Foster flexible work practices that provide employees with more choice and control over how, when, and where they work. Flexibility enables people to better manage work and personal priorities, which reduces stress, builds resilience, and enhances effectiveness.</li></ul><p><strong>Strengthen social support and connections within the team.</strong> There is mounting research that shows that people with greater social connections live longer, suffer less depression, stay healthier, and remain more resilient than those with few social connections. A Gallup Organization study found that one of the strongest predictors of an engaged employee is having a good friend at work. It's important that in addition to caring about doing a good job, team members also demonstrate caring for each other on a personal level.</p><p>Rather than thinking of these social connections as distractions from the \"real\" work, think of the time invested in building connections within the team as \"social capital\" that can yield many dividends.</p><ul><li>Make time for camaraderie, friendships, and fun on your team. Social occasions and celebrations can be effective, but little things also go a long way. You might set aside one day a week to have lunch together, or an hour a month for bagels, coffee, and conversation.</li><li>Build humour and fun into the hard work.</li><li>Plan team-building activities. These might include an outing, a workshop, a retreat, or another opportunity for people to get to know one another, appreciate one another's strengths and work styles, and build team spirit.</li><li>Build connections between team members who may never see one another. For example, it's a good idea to build in time at the beginning of conference calls for check-ins and casual conversation so that team members get to know a little about one another and have an opportunity to build connections.</li></ul><p><strong>Provide opportunities for all employees to learn and grow. </strong>As a manager, you play a key role in providing access to learning opportunities.</p><ul><li>No doubt your organization offers training programs and opportunities for professional development. It's your job to provide flexibility and to offer encouragement so that employees take advantage of these programs.</li><li>Performance management is another avenue for providing employees with opportunities for growth and development. And it's here that you as a manager have tremendous impact. Host periodic discussions with your team members about their individual goals and plans. Take the time to explore with employees the next steps for growth and make suggestions for how employees can achieve their goals. They will see that their desire for growth, training, and development is being acknowledged and supported.</li></ul><p><strong>Promote health and energy.</strong><em> </em>Other than modelling resilient attitudes and behaviours yourself, there are many ways that you as a manager can promote team health and energy.</p><ul><li>The simplest and most straightforward thing you can do is make team members aware of everything their employer offers in the way of stress management, time-management courses, health facilities, nutrition counselling, and health and wellness programs. Talk about how important you think these things are and encourage people to make use of them.</li><li>Schedule meetings and allow flexibility so that people can make use of these programs.</li><li>When you have team functions, provide food options that reinforce healthy eating habits.</li><li>Be intentional about encouraging people to take care of themselves as they also pursue business results.</li></ul><p>If you invest effort in building your team's resilience, there will be payoffs in the short term, but the biggest payoffs are in the expansion of capability and energy for the long term. Remember, small actions can make a big difference. You don't have to do everything all at once. But, resolve today to do at least one thing that will build greater resilience in your team.</p>",

            '<p>When are you too sick to go to work? As you think about what to do, it&rsquo;s important to consider both your own health and the health of co-workers who might catch your illness if you go to work.</p><p><strong>Staying home when you&rsquo;re sick</strong></p><p>No matter how miserable you feel, you may wonder if it really makes sense to stay home from work. After all, you might be able to get some work done even if you&rsquo;re coughing, sneezing, or sniffling. There are several good reasons to stay home when you&rsquo;re sick.</p><p><strong>You may give your illness to co-workers.</strong> Colds and flu usually spread through the droplets released when someone coughs or sneezes. They can also spread through contact with an object handled by an infected person. Cold and flu viruses can live for two hours or more on items such as desks, doorknobs, computer keyboards, and cafeteria tables, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). So you may give your illness to many others if you share a phone or fax machine, or handle papers that will be touched by co-workers or clients. Remember to wash your hands frequently and effectively as they are the primary source of spreading germs.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Working sick&rdquo; can be dangerous</strong><em>.</em> Many tasks that are usually safe can be risky if you have an illness that significantly weakens you or your ability to concentrate. Some obvious examples are operating machinery, driving a truck, and lifting heavy objects. But almost any job can be risky if you&rsquo;re too sick or tired to maintain good workplace safety habits. The drive to work itself might be dangerous, particularly if you are taking medications that cause drowsiness.</p><p><strong>Your condition may get worse if you don&rsquo;t take care of yourself.</strong> A cold is usually at its worst for only a few days; getting through the flu may take a week to ten days (though you may feel weak for a week or two longer). But if you don&rsquo;t take care of yourself, you may develop secondary illnesses due to a lowered resistance. Not allowing yourself to get over one illness may weaken your body&rsquo;s response to another infection. The risks of complications from &ldquo;routine&rdquo; illnesses may increase if you have a chronic condition such as heart disease, asthma, or diabetes.</p><p><strong>You&rsquo;ll be less productive at work.</strong> You won&rsquo;t be at your best if you&rsquo;re sick (especially if an illness has kept you from getting enough sleep). If you&rsquo;re taking prescription or over-the-counter medications to ease your symptoms, remember that medications can affect people in different ways. Some products may make you feel drowsy or less alert. You also risk making mistakes that might be costly to your team, your clients, or to your reputation at work.</p><p><strong>Ways to tell if you&rsquo;re healthy enough to go to work</strong></p><p>When you&rsquo;re trying to decide whether you&rsquo;re healthy enough to go to work, your body may send you mixed signals. You may look fine in the mirror, but feel sicker than you have in years. Or you may look awful but know it&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re sick&mdash;it&rsquo;s because you had a restless night for some other reason. To some extent, you&rsquo;ll need to use good judgment about whether to go to work. Here are some things to consider:</p><p><strong>Ask yourself if you would send your child to school or child care with the symptoms you have.</strong></p><p><strong>Ask yourself if you would want your co-worker to be working near you with the same symptoms.</strong></p><p><strong>Always pay attention to unusual symptoms.</strong> Watch for signs that you may have something more than a cold or flu. For example, the symptoms of conjunctivitis or &ldquo;pink eye&rdquo; include matted eyelashes and bright pink eyes with significant amounts of white or yellow discharge at the corners. This disease is highly contagious and, if you go to work, may spread rapidly among your co-workers.</p><p><strong>Pay extra attention to your health if you feel like you are &ldquo;coming down with something.&rdquo;</strong> Go to bed a half hour earlier and get up a half hour earlier to give yourself more time to see how you feel before going to work. If you usually get up late and get ready for work in a rush, you may make a hasty judgment that you&rsquo;ll regret later in the day. Get up a little earlier, and you&rsquo;ll have more time to see how you feel.</p><p><strong>Be honest about how much time you will need to devote to being ill while at work.</strong> For example, if you are having nausea, will you need to make frequent bathroom trips that will take you away from meetings or your desk? Will you be able to be around others who are eating or drinking without feeling like you are going to be ill?</p><p><strong>Talk with your health care provider about what to do.</strong></p><p><strong>Other issues to consider when calling in sick</strong></p><p>When deciding whether to call in sick, you may also find it helpful to consider the following:</p><p><strong>Be familiar with your employer&rsquo;s policy regarding time off for an illness</strong>. For example, do you need a doctor\'s note? Be aware as well of how much time off you have taken through the year and for what reasons.</p><p><strong>Find out from your manager if you can work from home for a half or full day (if your job permits).</strong></p><p><strong>Consider current business needs and how your absence will affect others. </strong></p><p>If you have concerns, talk with your manager or HR about the best way to handle the situation.</p><p><strong>Calling in sick</strong></p><p>If you do have to miss work, it&rsquo;s important to follow your company policies.</p><p><strong>Know how your manager wants you to call in sick.</strong> Find out if your manager wants you to call a specific number, specific people, or to call in by a certain time. Also, find out if you need to provide a replacement for your position or someone to take over work that is due.</p><p><strong>Make the call yourself.</strong> Don&rsquo;t ask someone else to call in for you. Making the call yourself shows that you take responsibility for your work. Be clear and to the point: &ldquo;I have a bad cold, so I&rsquo;m going to stay home today.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Call in as soon as you know you&rsquo;re going to stay home.</strong> This gives your manager the maximum amount of time to find someone to perform any tasks that have to be done that day. If you expect your illness will keep you home for more than a day, say so. This will help your manager plan for your absence.</p><p><strong>Follow company absence reporting procedures.</strong> Failure to do so could impact any salary continuation that you may be eligible for within your company&rsquo;s disability insurance plan.</p><p><strong>Let your supervisor know what you are doing to recuperate.</strong> If you have a doctor&rsquo;s appointment, tell her so that she understands that you are doing what you can to return to work as soon as you are physically able to do so.</p><p><strong>Making sure you and others stay healthy at work</strong></p><p>When you&rsquo;re healthy enough to go to work, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that you and others stay that way.</p><p><strong>Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.</strong> Don&rsquo;t cough directly into your hands. This is how germs spread. If you can, cough into your elbow. This keeps your hands from becoming loaded with germs that will pass easily to others. Use disposable tissues and throw them away afterward.</p><p><strong>Wash your hands frequently.</strong> Use soap and warm water if possible. The CDC recommends that you wash for about 20 seconds, or the amount of time it takes to sing &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; twice. If you can&rsquo;t wash with soap and water, use alcohol-based disposable hand wipes or gel sanitizers. (These don&rsquo;t need water to be effective.) Keep a bottle of gel sanitizer at your desk and in your car, using it before you touch your face or mouth, or eat.</p><p><strong>Take precautions if a co-worker seems ill.</strong> If a co-worker is coughing or sneezing, you might say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned about getting sick. Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t use the same phone today.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put off our lunch date until next week.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Keep your distance from co-workers and others if you suspect you may be coming down with something.</strong> It&rsquo;s OK to ask your manager to excuse you from a meeting or from tasks that involve a lot of contact with others if you think you may be getting sick.</p><p><strong>Staying healthy</strong></p><p><strong>If you often have an itchy, runny nose or watery eyes, talk with your doctor to find out if you have allergies.</strong> Colds and allergies can have similar symptoms. But there are important differences: Colds are contagious, and allergies aren&rsquo;t. And although you can&rsquo;t cure a cold, you may be able to reduce allergy problems by taking medication or avoiding substances that cause a reaction.</p><p><strong>Maintain good health habits. </strong>Exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, limit your alcohol consumption, avoid use of tobacco products, and get enough sleep. If you drink too much or sleep too little, you may feel awful because you&rsquo;re sleep deprived.</p><p><strong>Consult your health care provider if you frequently feel too sick to go to work.</strong> You may have an underlying condition that needs attention.</p><p><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> Drinking lots of water helps prevent dehydration. If possible, keep a water bottle at your desk, and try to finish it while you&rsquo;re working. Drinking water helps prevent nasal congestion due to dry indoor heat.</p><p><strong>Stay up to date on recommended immunizations, including the seasonal flu vaccine.</strong> Recommendations for your age are available at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/vaccination-adults.html">www.canada.ca</a>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like more information on colds, flu, and other common illnesses, visit the website for the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>. This site is updated frequently and has extensive information on a wide variety of health concerns, including both practical advice and late-breaking news bulletins on topics such as the availability of flu vaccine. Your company website may also offer health-related information.</p><p>Finally, remember that you can get colds and flu in any season. All year long, it&rsquo;s important to do everything you can to protect your health and the health of co-workers.</p>',

            '<p>You don&rsquo;t need to leave the house to stay fit. There are things you can do to stay healthy and incorporate fitness into your home life. Here are some ideas to get you started!<br /> <br /> Despite the reasons, millions of us get regular exercise without a gym membership. Here are some of the many ways to get regular exercise on your own:</p><p><strong>Make a space at home</strong>. If you do not have a lot of space to dedicate to working out, find things you can do that require less movement. Strength training, yoga, or Pilates all require limited space. Try putting floor coasters under the legs of a table or couch so you can easily move it aside to give yourself more room. If you\'re streaming a workout on an app or watching along with a DVD, be sure to set things up so you can see the screen.</p><p><strong>Follow along with a recorded workout.</strong> There\'s a huge industry of exercise videos, and in many cases they\'re free to view. You can stream online videos on your computer, smartphone, or device. To find them, try searching YouTube for "free workouts" or "exercise videos," for example. If you find one you like, you can also build a collection of paid workout videos from instructors you like.</p><p><strong>Invest in equipment</strong>. Exercise equipment doesn\'t have to be bulky or expensive, and there are many ways to exercise where equipment isn\'t even necessary. But, if you choose to invest in equipment, find pieces that fit your space and style. Skipping ropes, mats, exercise bands, hand weights, or pull-up bars take up minimal space. Before making a large investment, like purchasing a treadmill or rowing machine, make sure the machine provides a type of workout you\'ll enjoy and be willing and able to do often.</p><p><strong>Make the time.</strong> Sometimes it can be hard to find a block of time to exercise for at least 30 minutes. Fortunately, research shows that exercising for 10 minutes three times a day provides many of the same health benefits as exercising for 30 minutes straight. Make it a priority to schedule mini-workouts during the day and evening.</p><p><strong>Work activity into your day.</strong> The best results come from combining planned periods of exercise with increased overall movement. For example, park farther away, use the stairs instead of taking the lift, or leave the car at home when going somewhere nearby. Walk to the farthest bathroom when possible. Take a moment to stretch after responding to emails. Pace or use hand weights while you\'re on the phone or watching TV.</p><p><strong>Be creative</strong>. Not everyone enjoys lifting weights. Be creative and find what works for you. You might try having a family dance party before or after dinner, using a hula hoop while watching TV, or skipping during commercial breaks. Try listening to your favourite music or an audiobook to make the time pass more quickly as you&rsquo;re working out.</p><p><strong>Get connected</strong>. If you use a smartphone or tablet, a huge variety of fitness apps are available for exercise reminders, guidance and tips. Apps like <a href="http://www.fitradio.com/">Fit Radio</a> stream DJ music mixes with a consistent beat. Try the app <a href="https://sworkit.com/">Sworkit</a> for guided exercise routines that last 5-60 minutes. There are many apps to help you track your habits and keep you motivated, like <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/exercise/lookup">MyFitnessPal</a> or <a href="http://www.habitica.com/">Habitica</a>.</p><p><strong>Join a virtual group</strong>. Some people like the competitive nature of fitness challenges. If you can\'t find one already sponsored by your company or an online community, create your own and invite friends and family to participate virtually.<br /> Getting started is always the hardest part. Start small and make sure your reasons for increasing your activity are personal. Set realistic and achievable goals, track your progress and have fun!</p>',

            "<p>We may have the best of intentions when making plans to eat well, exercise and get more sleep, but then a stressful situation, a new challenge or a life-changing circumstance throws everything off and we end up back at square one. However, it is possible to gain traction with health and lifestyle changes and begin to see benefits even when life happens.</p><p>Here are a few techniques to consider when trying to establish lasting routines and habits:</p><p><strong>Identify your intrinsic motivation.</strong> Intrinsic motivation is what drives our actions in the long term. It is our deep desire for something that we value. You can identify it when you hear yourself say, &ldquo;I want to&hellip;&rdquo; versus, &ldquo;I need to&hellip;,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have to&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I should&hellip;.&rdquo; Identify all the positive reasons you want to do something and write them down in a wellness journal that you can then review to remind yourself of your goals and revise them over time.</p><p><strong>Set a time, make a plan and commit.</strong> Remind yourself of the reason you want to make a change or form a positive habit and develop specific strategies outlining when and how you&rsquo;ll do it. For instance, &ldquo;I will drink eight glasses of water per day by drinking one while the coffee is brewing, four while at work, one while cooking dinner, and two after dinner while watching television. I want to do it because I have more energy when I am well hydrated.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Pair your good intention with something you&rsquo;re already doing</strong>. Pick an established routine like brushing your teeth and perform the routine or habit you&rsquo;re trying to establish immediately after. This will help you remember to stay on track.</p><p><strong>Make a list of all the benefits of the habit you&rsquo;re adopting.</strong> You might surprise yourself when you start listing all the positive things it will do for you.</p><p><strong>Practice self-compassion.</strong> On the days when you&rsquo;re committed to performing your new routine or habit, tell yourself that you'll do it for five to ten minutes. Then, you will give yourself permission to stop if you&rsquo;re not feeling up to continuing. This works particularly well with habits like exercise because many times getting started is our biggest roadblock.</p><p><strong>Flex your mindfulness muscle.</strong> When you're doing the activity think about what you&rsquo;re noticing and appreciating about it. This will make you more present in the moment, anchoring the quality of life benefits you perceive and value.</p><p><strong>Think of building healthy habits as an experiment.</strong> It&rsquo;s important not to put unnecessary stress on yourself. It takes time to figure out what works and what doesn't. Seeing your habit as a learning experience will help you will succeed. Once you've established clear benefits to forming your habit, it will be hard not to continue because you don't want to give up what you gain in quality of life.</p><p><strong>Develop a minimum necessary standard.</strong> Paring down your healthy habits to the basics like sleep, hydration, nutrition, and some form of exercise can help you when you go through periods of peak stress. When life calms down a bit, you can resume the healthy habits you&rsquo;re developing to keep you on track to live your best life.</p>",

            '<p>Did you know that <em>happiness</em> is the single best word that captures the construct, or concept, of well-being? When we are happy, we experience positive emotions that allow us to broaden our perspective and build our resources, according to Dr. Barbara Frederickson, author of <em>Positivity</em>.</p><p>On the flip side, when we’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed or are experiencing the symptoms of depression, we get tunnel vision and make shortsighted decisions out of our instinct for self-preservation. In these situations, we can often have trouble seeing the goodness in life, making it difficult to sustain the healthy habits that make us feel good and keep us on track. At its most basic level, stress can sabotage us and our best efforts.</p><p>Here are several strategies you can use to boost your level of happiness—the antidote to stress—in both the short term and long term:</p><p><strong>Identify your unique “Flow states.”</strong> In his book <em>Flow</em>, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes <em>Flow</em> as the “sweet spot” between challenge and skill. To identify when you are in flow, ask yourself: What am I doing when I…</p><ul><li>am at my most creative?</li><li>lose all sense of time?</li><li>feel most alive?</li><li>am so caught up in the moment that I cease to exist?</li></ul><p>By using your flow states, you can expect to more effectively renew and recharge, positioning yourself for greater happiness, life satisfaction and optimal performance.</p><p><strong>Practice “Gratitude Spotting” and journaling.</strong> Being mindful of and reflecting on the things we are grateful for is key to happiness. Martin E.P. Seligman, author of <em>Authentic Happiness</em>, says that people who practice gratitude spotting and journaling are more optimistic and happier. Keep an electronic or paper journal and plan to find a quiet time and place every day to write down a minimum of three things you’re grateful for. By doing this you are establishing a happiness-enhancing habit.</p><p><strong>Savor life’s pleasures.</strong> According to Seligman, <em>savoring</em> is an awareness of pleasure and the deliberate, conscious attention to the experience. Focus on these steps:</p><ul><li>Be in the moment and tell others how much it means to you.</li><li>Take a mental or physical souvenir to build a memory, like a shell from the beach where you took your last vacation.</li><li>Fully appreciate and bask in the moment to remind yourself how long you’ve waited for this good thing.</li><li>Sharpen your perception by zeroing in on the “good stuff,” like closing your eyes while you enjoy a piece of music.</li><li>Afterward, absorb and marvel in how you lost yourself in the moment.</li></ul><p><strong>Take Action.</strong> Pick one strategy you’d like to practice from the list above and develop a goal outlining what you’ll do, when you’ll do it, for how long, and on which days of the week. After practicing the habit for one to two weeks, do some self-reflection. What benefits did you notice? What did this practice provide for you? What did you learn? </p><p>Readjust the goal based on your newfound awareness and keep going. Research shows that there is a positive, cumulative effect when we increase our happiness, decrease our stress levels, and boost our resiliency in the long term.</p>',

            '<p>The recent outbreak of COVID-19, which may be commonly known as “coronavirus” or “Wuhan coronavirus,” has now been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to the death toll and the spread of the virus overseas.</p><p>The first cases appeared in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province in China, in December 2019. There have been confirmed cases in many other countries. For more information about affected regions, click <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd">here</a>.</p><p><strong>What is COVID-19?</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 is a virus that falls under the coronavirus “family” of respiratory viruses. It can cause breathing difficulties in those who have contracted it. Experts believe that it probably originated from human contact with animals, as these types of viruses are found most often in animals. In the case of the COVID-19, expert believe that it the outbreak may have spread due do illegal trading of exotic animals.</p><p><strong>What are the symptoms?</strong></p><p>The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of a cold of flu: fever, headache, dry cough, and body aches with the added symptom of breathing problems. The incubation period during which a person has the disease but is not exhibiting symptoms can be between one day and two weeks. It’s possible that the virus can be passed on to others during the incubation period before the person carrying starts to exhibit symptoms.</p><p>It’s important to seek medical treatment if you think you might have contracted COVID-19.</p><p><strong>How can I avoid getting COVID-19?</strong></p><p>The only way to get COVID-19 is to be in close physical contact with a person or animal that has contracted the virus. Because those who have been infected might not show symptoms for up to two weeks, it’s important to remain vigilant.</p><p>To best avoid catching COVID-19, the WHO recommends practicing good hand hygiene (washing hands with soap and water) and respiratory hygiene (sneezing into your elbow instead of your hand), and avoiding any unnecessary physical contact with wild animals. Practice “physical distancing”—maintain at least a metre (3 feet) of distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, as these are the easiest way for viruses to enter your system. If you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care immediately.</p><p>There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</strong></p><p>No. COVID-19 and SARS come from the same group of viruses, called coronaviruses. There can be some confusion here, as many people refer to COVID-19 as simply “coronavirus”—but COVID-19 is not the same virus as SARS. It’s also believed that because of the SARS outbreak of 2003, China is better-equipped to handle this virus outbreak.</p><p><strong>Where can I find out more information?</strong></p><p>WHO releases daily <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">reports</a> on the effects of COVID-19. </p><p>You can also find out more information from the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus.html">Health Canada website</a>.</p>',

            '<p>The modern study of neuroplasticity has shown that how we think and behave can actually alter the structure of the brain. Positivity&mdash;positive thinking&mdash;can rewire the brain. By practicing positivity, we can train ourselves to be happier and more resilient overall. This article offers practical strategies on how to break negative thought patterns and practice positivity.</p><p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong></p><p>The brain was once thought of as static&mdash;unchangeable&mdash;meaning once the brain was formed, you couldn&rsquo;t change it. The good news, scientists have discovered, is that the brain is not unchangeable. In fact, we change our brains every day without even realizing it. Every habit you practice, each skill you learn, causes your brain to strengthen certain connections and weaken others. Our environment, habits, emotions, behaviors, and thoughts all have an impact on our brain.</p><p>Neuroplasticity makes the brain resilient because our brains learn, adapt, and grow based on our actions and experiences. The brain&rsquo;s neuroplasticity is what makes all permanent learning possible&mdash;for example when you learn to play a musical instrument or speak a foreign language. It&rsquo;s also how we overcome and recover from medical issues such as a stroke or other brain injury, depression, and many other illnesses.</p><p>Being able to change our brains in positive ways&mdash;to learn, to recover and heal&mdash;is a wonderful thing. However, on the flip side, our brains are also vulnerable to our external environment and even internal influences. This means that in the same way that we can heal, grow, and improve our brains and thoughts, we can also injure our brains and stay stuck in negative thoughts and behaviours.</p><h3><strong>What negative thinking and worry do to the brain</strong></h3><p>As humans, we naturally focus on the negative&mdash;we are hardwired that way to keep ourselves safe from threats. In fact, when confronted with negativity or a potential threat, our brains activate more intensely than they do when an equally intense good or positive situation presents itself.</p><p>Interestingly, even just <em>thinking </em>about negativity activates the same parts in the brain as a real active threat to our safety or well-being. And while a negative thought or situation can &ldquo;stick&rdquo; in our brains after a split second, it takes 10 or more seconds of focusing on a positive thought for our brain to translate that positivity from our active memory to short-term memory and eventually to long-term memory.</p><p>There are also physical, emotional, and behavioural symptoms typically associated with negative thinking and worry:</p><p>Physical symptoms</p><ul><li>muscle tension and muscle pain</li><li>headaches</li><li>digestive problems</li><li>chest pain</li><li>reduced libido or sex drive</li><li>sleep problems</li><li>fatigue</li></ul><p>Emotional symptoms</p><ul><li>anxiety</li><li>mood changes</li><li>restlessness</li><li>irritability and anger</li><li>depression or sadness</li><li>lack of focus or motivation</li></ul><p>Behavioural symptoms</p><ul><li>changes in appetite (either over- or undereating)</li><li>abuse of alcohol and/or drugs</li><li>social withdrawal</li><li>outbursts of anger</li><li>tobacco/nicotine use</li></ul><p>Although it&rsquo;s necessary for our brains to let us know when we are in danger or there is a threat, we need to be careful not to let negative thoughts take over our lives. The more our thought patterns tend to be negative, the easier it becomes to return to these automatic negative thought patterns. In fact, rumination (constantly turning over a situation in one&rsquo;s mind and focusing on its negative aspects) can damage structures and connections in the brain that regulate emotions, memory, and feelings. As we focus more on the negative, over time, it becomes more difficult to</p><p><strong>The benefits of positive thinking</strong></p><p>Not only is positive thinking a helpful way to reduce automatic negative reactions, but there are also many physical and emotional health benefits associated with thinking positively.</p><p>The physical health benefits of positive thinking can help:</p><ul><li>boost your immune system</li><li>improve heart health</li><li>reduce or prevent hypertension</li><li>lower stress levels</li><li>boost resilience</li></ul><p>As you increase your positive thinking, you&rsquo;ll feel healthier in general, which can empower and motivate you to increase your healthy habits.</p><p>The emotional health benefits of positive thinking can help you:</p><ul><li>handle problems more effectively</li><li>enjoy your life more</li><li>develop positive habits</li><li>boost your self-esteem</li><li>form healthy, positive relationships more easily (It&rsquo;s easier to see the good in others when you&rsquo;re looking at your world through a positive lens.)</li></ul><h3><strong>How to change negative thoughts and think more positively</strong></h3><p>For individuals struggling with depression, the following tips won&rsquo;t necessarily substitute for professional treatment, but they can work when done together with therapy and/or medication to help you feel better.</p><p><strong>Engage in an activity that fully occupies the mind,</strong> <strong>such as doing a crossword puzzle.</strong> This can be helpful in breaking out of ruminative thought patterns.</p><p><strong>Practice mindfulness or meditation.</strong> Focusing on the here and now and being present is a valuable way to change negative thought patterns and brain activity. Meditating regularly can help shift negative thought patterns, help the brain focus, and even slow the loss of brain cells. These apps can help you get started with meditating: <a href="https://buddhify.com/">Buddhify</a>, <a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>, <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Headspace</a>, <a href="http://themindfulnessapp.com/">The Mindfulness App</a>, and <a href="https://www.sattva.life/">Sattva</a>.</p><p><strong>Practice Yoga. </strong>Like meditation, yoga helps make you more aware of your own self-talk. Being aware of negative self-talk prompts you to make a change.</p><p><strong>Consciously replace your thoughts.</strong> Make it a point to change your negative thinking by replacing a negative thought with a positive one.</p><p><strong>Smile.</strong> It has been proven to improve your mood and thought patterns. Smiling sends positive thoughts to the brain.</p><p><strong>Sing.</strong> Singing has been scientifically proven to fight depression and boost one&rsquo;s mood.</p><p><strong>Make a list of things you&rsquo;re worried or stressed about to get your worries out of your head.</strong> Then make another list of things you feel positive or grateful for. Next, make an effort to shift the focus of your brain from negative to positive thoughts.</p><p><strong>Write in a gratitude journal.</strong> Keeping a gratitude journal can help increase psychological well-being.</p><p><strong>Read something positive.</strong> Doing so can boost your mood and give you a mental break.</p><p><strong>Be around positive thinkers.</strong> Your attitude will tend to follow that of your friends.</p><p><strong>Help someone else solve a problem.</strong> Take a break from thinking about yourself and do what you can to help someone else. It will help bring a sense of accomplishment and can help you gain a new perspective on your own problems.</p><p><strong>Take control of your life. </strong>Make choices to change what you can control.</p><p>It&rsquo;s tough to start, but as you work at it and intentionally take steps to improve yourself, you&rsquo;ll build stronger connections between positive thinking and challenges, and you&rsquo;ll be on your way to a more positive outlook.</p>',

            '<p><p>Change is a natural part of life. Most of us are continually making adjustments that reflect our changing needs or interests&mdash;switching majors in school, moving to another city, or adjusting to a new job. Some changes are sudden and unexpected which can be a challenge to accept. This article series will help you find the best strategy for coping with change&mdash;whether planned, unexpected, difficult, or positive&mdash;and learn to focus on what you can control, while letting go of what you can&rsquo;t.</p><p><strong>Understanding the benefits of change</strong></p><p>Many people have negative reactions when they first hear that they&rsquo;ll be facing a big change. Some people cry or become angry. Others think &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to handle this,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to learn a new way of doing things.&rdquo; It may help to remember that a change&mdash;even if you don&rsquo;t want it&mdash;can be beneficial.</p><p>Change can be rewarding because it&hellip;</p><p><strong>Provides a chance to learn and grow.</strong> New experiences can bring greater knowledge and awareness if you allow them to.</p><p><strong>Gives you a new perspective.</strong> Sometimes when you are forced to make choices and decisions, you realize what it is you really value.</p><p><strong>Brings new opportunities.</strong> Change may be difficult but it may also bring about unexpected, new opportunities such as meeting new friends or developing new healthy habits.</p><p><strong>Helps you stay flexible.</strong> It&rsquo;s easy to fall into a rut or become &ldquo;set in your ways.&rdquo; A change in one area of life can help you stay flexible and may help you make other changes in your life.</p><p><strong>Builds self-confidence.</strong> Staying in a comfortable situation can be fine for a while. But over time, it can become tedious or cause you to lose confidence in your ability to do well at other different tasks or in new settings.</p><p><strong>Makes you grow and become stronger.</strong> When you accept and successfully cope with a tough change, it will help you become stronger for the next change.</p><h3>Change and stress</h3><p>Change can seem very stressful at first, even if it will be rewarding in the long run. There are many kinds of change and everyone reacts differently to events&mdash;whether they are happy ones such as the birth of a baby, difficult ones such as a divorce, or even smaller events such as an upcoming holiday or vacation.</p><p>&ldquo;Stress is just your body\'s way of reacting to change. It\'s okay to feel stressed even when something good has happened&mdash;in fact, it\'s normal.&rdquo;<br /> Stephanie A. Sarkis Ph.D., <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201701/10-ways-cope-big-changes"><em>Psychology Today</em></a></p><p>Typically, the more significant the change, the more stress you may face. Many people find it particularly difficult to move from one major stage of life to another&mdash;for example, leaving school, having a child, reaching midlife, becoming a stepparent or grandparent, or retiring.</p><p>Change can be both physically and mentally stressful, so, it&rsquo;s important to recognize the signs of stress. The physical and mental symptoms of stress may include the following:</p><ul><li>headaches, neck aches, or backaches</li><li>depression</li><li>anxiety</li><li>fatigue</li><li>overeating</li><li>difficulty sleeping</li><li>irritability or mood swings</li><li>poor concentration</li><li>stomachaches or other digestive problems</li><li>alcohol or drug abuse</li><li>eating disorders</li><li>heart trouble</li><li>decreased sexual drive</li></ul><p>Even if you look forward to a change, adjusting to new realities can be stressful. One key to coping with these kinds of difficulties is to remember that, with support, most people can adapt well. Depending on the nature of the change you face, you may want to turn to your family or friends, your manager or co-workers, a professional counsellor, or a support group whose members know what you&rsquo;re going through and want to help. You can also call your employee assistance program (EAP) to speak with a counsellor who can support you.</p><h3>Helpful tips on coping with change</h3><p>Facing change can be difficult but, with the right attitude and support, you can find the positive in it. Here are some tips on coping with change.</p><p><strong>Expect and accept change.</strong> Take steps to avoid becoming rigid and afraid of new experiences. Throughout life, keep making friends, exploring a variety of interests and activities, and accepting new challenges at work.</p><p><strong>Take care of your physical and emotional health.</strong> If you&rsquo;re facing a big change, take extra care to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and limit your alcohol consumption. Learn and practice some relaxation techniques by taking a yoga class or following a guided meditation online. Take some breaks and make time to do something you find enjoyable with friends or family.</p><p><strong>Keep an open mind.</strong> Just because you haven&rsquo;t done something before doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t like it. And just because you&rsquo;ve tried something once and it didn&rsquo;t turn out as well as expected, doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll have the same result next time.</p><p><strong>Stay positive.</strong> Hold on to your sense of humour. Laughter is a stress-breaker and it helps us not take life too seriously. Remember, you have a choice as to how you respond to the changes you face. Keeping a positive attitude will help you through the tough times.</p><p><strong>Take it slow.</strong> Making a change is really a series of small transitions. You will find it easier to cope with a big change by breaking it down into small steps so that you can make gradual adjustments over time.</p><p><strong>Gather information.</strong> The most stressful thing about change may be the uncertainty it brings. To ease your anxieties, learn as much as you can about what you&rsquo;re facing. Do research online or at the library. Talk with friends and co-workers who&rsquo;ve faced the same kind of changes you&rsquo;re facing and ask what helped them the most. A book you may find helpful is <em>Transitions: Making Sense of Life&rsquo;s Changes</em>, Revised 25th Anniversary Edition, by William Bridges, which describes the stages of change and how to deal with them.</p><p><strong>Identify obstacles.</strong> Just about everyone encounters obstacles that get in the way of change. Taking the time to write yours down will help you know and understand your own obstacles. From there, you can work to figure out how to get past the obstacles you may be facing.</p><p>&ldquo;Accept the past, but fight for the future. Even though we are never free from change, we are always free to decide how we respond to it.&rdquo;<br /> Nick Tasler, <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/how-to-get-better-at-dealing-with-change"><em>Harvard Business Review</em></a></p><p><strong>Pace yourself.</strong> Avoid taking on a big change before you&rsquo;ve adjusted to another one, or trying to make too many smaller changes all at once. If you know that you&rsquo;re already experiencing stress, try to postpone making big decisions that will bring about change and, possibly, more stress.</p><p><strong>Talk about your feelings with loved ones who can help.</strong> Be as specific as you can about your concerns. You might say to your partner, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had more responsibilities at work since I&rsquo;ve been promoted, and it&rsquo;s become harder for me to make dinner every night. What can we do about this?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Consider joining a support group.</strong> If a change feels too big to handle alone, consider joining a support group for people who are going through a similar experience. You can find groups listed in the calendar of events in your local newspaper or by searching online for a national organization devoted to the issue that concerns you.</p><p><strong>Seek professional help if you are having difficulty coping with change.</strong> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help. Most people benefit from support and guidance when faced with tough circumstances. Your employee assistance program (EAP) or other confidential counselling services available to you can provide you with resources and help.</p>',

            '<p>The recent outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 has a lot of people self-isolating. While necessary to curb the spread of the disease, self-isolation can lead to people feeling cut off from society, like they&rsquo;ve lost their routine, or are being forced to take time out from important relationships.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re self-isolating, you&rsquo;re not alone; thousands of people are taking this important measure. This article will show you ways that you can combat loneliness while following self-isolation rules.</p><p><strong>Self-isolation vs. physical distancing</strong></p><p>Self-isolation is a precautionary measure that&rsquo;s meant to benefit society by removing carriers and potential carriers of COVID-19 from the general population in order to protect the safety of the most vulnerable. It means removing yourself from the general population by staying at home for a recommended number of days. You may need assistance with things like grocery shopping and pharmacy runs.</p><p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html">Health Canada</a> has up to date guidelines about who should be self-isolating. Please refer to them for more information.  check with your local health authority for more information on who should be self-isolating.</p><p>You might have also heard the term &ldquo;physical distancing.&rdquo; This is when someone tries to avoid contact with other people even though they have not been exposed to COVID-19. Physical distancing means:</p><ul><li>staying at home whenever possible</li><li>working from home if that&rsquo;s an option for you</li><li>avoiding crowded public places such as shops, bars, restaurants, and gyms</li><li>avoiding public transit where large groups of people are brought together such as buses, trains, and planes</li><li>limiting contact with people known to have been travelling, or have contracted or have come into contact with someone who has contracted COVID-19</li></ul><p>By choosing to physical distancing, someone is actively trying to limit the spread of the virus.</p><p><strong>Loneliness and self-isolation</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that self-isolation and all the actions it requires might lead to loneliness. Even if you have a partner, children, or roommates self-isolating with you, it&rsquo;s natural to miss the routine that seeing other people brings.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re in self-isolation, it might help to remind yourself that you&rsquo;re not just doing it for your benefit&mdash;you&rsquo;re doing it to ensure that those who are more vulnerable (people who are immuno-compromised, elderly, or already sick) aren&rsquo;t at risk.</p><p>Other things that may help alleviate feelings of loneliness include:</p><p><strong>Connect with family and friends. </strong>Arrange for phone or video calls with loved ones, even if it&rsquo;s just to check in. You might find that other people are sharing your worries, and connecting can be a great way to see you&rsquo;re not alone.</p><p><strong>Pick a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; project and finish it. </strong>If you&rsquo;re stuck inside, you might find that you have too much free time. Why not pick up that book you&rsquo;ve been meaning to finish, that instrument you&rsquo;ve been meaning to learn how to play, or that recipe you&rsquo;ve been itching to try? If you&rsquo;re struggling, look to social media like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, to connect with other people who share your interests.</p><p><strong>Look into community resources available to you. </strong>Nextdoor, the social media platform that connects neighbours, can be a great resource if you need help with errands, groceries deliveries, and packages that need to be picked up. (Be sure to follow guidelines for safety to avoid scams or protect yourself.) Also, you may want to take advantage of grocery and takeout delivery and services are now offering &ldquo;no contact&rdquo; options.</p><p><strong>Find creative ways to get exercise. </strong>Are you spending all day in your pajamas? Do you have an established routine? Sometimes, feeling like you&rsquo;re all alone can come from a sense of purposelessness. The best way to not get lethargic when you&rsquo;re at home is to have some goals in mind throughout the day, including exercise. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be complicated: if you don&rsquo;t have a running or spin machine at home, you can still do push-ups and sit-ups. Search YouTube for an at-home workout that doesn&rsquo;t require weights if you&rsquo;re unsure where to start!</p><p><strong>If you are able to go outside without breaking the rules of your self-isolation, get some fresh air. </strong>This can be tricky, but if you can have a cup of tea in a garden or on a balcony, it will help negate the feeling that you&rsquo;re stuck at home. Even if you don&rsquo;t have outdoor space at your home, try opening the windows to let in fresh air.</p><p><strong>Connect with your assistance program. </strong>Trained counsellors are always available to talk about issues of stress, worry, isolation, and fears about the future. Get in touch with your assistance program if COVID-19 is causing you stress or anxiety</p>',

            '<p>A positive attitude or optimistic outlook doesn’t just make you feel better. It can strengthen your relationships with friends, family, and co-workers and make it easier to deal with everything from a bad day at work to a major life change. A positive outlook isn’t just something that you’re born with—it’s a skill that you can learn. Here are some tips:</p><p><strong>Practice talking back to yourself. </strong>Try to turn your negative thoughts into positive ones. Instead of thinking, “I’ll never make it to the end of my shift,” say, “I can do this. And at the end of the day, I’ll go for a long walk to reward myself for getting through this crunch.” When you have a problem, tell yourself, “I’ll find one small thing I can do that will help. Things are going to get better.”</p><p><strong>Spend time with optimistic people. </strong>Moods can be contagious, and negative thinking spreads quickly, especially at work. If you spend time with people who have a positive outlook, you may start thinking more positively, too.</p><p><strong>Keep learning and growing. </strong>Learning new things—whether it’s how to fish or use a new software program—gives you confidence. Try something new whenever you can, and avoid thoughts that begin with, “I’m too old to . . .” or “I don’t have enough time to . . .”</p><p><strong>Make time for the things that make you happy. </strong>Whether it’s spending time with friends, going to the movies, listening to music you love, or just playing with your kids or dog, make the activities you love to do a priority.</p><p><strong>Bring more humour into your life. </strong>A sense of humour is a great stress-buster. Spend time with fun people, share jokes with friends on social media, or watch funny movies at home.</p><p><strong>Get moving.</strong> Moderate-to-vigorous exercise triggers the release of endorphins, natural feel-good chemicals in the brain. Getting your endorphins going can lead to an overall positive feeling in your body that your attitude will reflect.</p><p><strong>Have things to look forward to, </strong>whether it’s a weekend get-together with family, going to the gym after a tough day at work, or calling a friend you haven’t talked to in a while.</p><p><strong>Practice gratitude. </strong>Spend a few minutes each day reflecting on the good things in your life or sharing them with a friend or relative. Try keeping a gratitude journal.</p>',

            '<p>The constant news media and health organization warnings of a possible flu pandemic may cause us to worry about our own and our family&rsquo;s health and safety. While it is perfectly normal to be concerned, there are steps you can take to be prepared to cope with a pandemic should it occur in your community.</p><p><strong>Get the facts</strong></p><p>Having the facts and understanding the potential threat is the best defence.</p><p><strong>Get the facts on flu:</strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;flu <em>pandemic</em>&rdquo; is defined as a new influenza (flu) virus that spreads easily between humans and affects a wide geographic area.</li><li>The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that Influenza <em>epidemics </em>usually occur yearly during autumn and winter in temperate regions.</li><li>While the flu may cause only mild symptoms in most healthy adults, some flu strains can be life-threatening for young children, the elderly or individuals with chronic illness.</li></ul><p><strong>Keep up-to-date</strong> on flu pandemic status in your area. Find a reliable source of information, such as your local public health office, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization. Since a flu pandemic can evolve rapidly, gather information regularly so you can take appropriate action when necessary.</p><p><strong>Develop a plan</strong></p><p>Being prepared to respond if a flu pandemic spreads to your community can greatly lessen your anxiety. Since a pandemic can last a number of weeks, you may want to consider:</p><ul><li>Stocking up on non-perishable foods, water, flu medicine, etc., in case officials recommend staying home or you self-isolate due to a family member becoming ill</li><li>Developing a plan for how you would care for sick family members</li><li>Creating an emergency communication plan to keep in touch with other family members or friends if you or they become isolated</li><li>Using community resources or websites to create a family preparedness checklist that you can follow, should a pandemic occur in your area.</li></ul><p><strong>Manage your anxiety</strong></p><p>While we all have our own personal response to a crisis, depending on our cultural, social and religious backgrounds, most of us will feel some level of anxiety during a pandemic. This can cause both physical and emotional reactions. To manage your anxiety and fear, try to put the potential threat or current events in context by keeping a broader, more hopeful perspective. You can &ldquo;reframe&rdquo; your thinking by focusing on your strength and resourcefulness. By seeing yourself as a survivor you can boost your confidence, accept the situation and focus on circumstances that you <strong>can control.</strong></p><p>Also be watchful for physical affects of anxiety, such as trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. Concern about the pandemic may also intensify the effects of other stresses in our daily lives. This can impact your built-in physical stress response, which may leave you more vulnerable to the flu as well as other health risks. It is therefore important to take care of yourself and build your resilience.</p><p><strong>What is resilience?</strong></p><p>Resilience is the ability to effectively cope with, recover from or adapt to challenging life situations. A person who is resilient is able to cope with crisis situations due to behaviours, thoughts and actions that they have learned and developed. The steps to building resilience differ from person to person, based on culture, values, beliefs and inter-personal relationships. However, some common resilience-building factors include having:</p><ul><li>a positive view of your strengths and abilities</li><li>the capacity to make realistic plans and take steps to carry them out</li><li>the ability to manage strong feelings and impulses</li><li>a sense of purpose and long term focus</li><li>a social support network</li></ul><p><strong>Tips for building resilience</strong></p><p>We can boost our resilience levels in a number of ways, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep a positive outlook. </strong>Having an optimistic attitude can help you focus on the good things in your life, rather than worrying about things you may not be able to control. This means acknowledging your own strength, resourcefulness and abilities. This will help you avoid seeing the pandemic as an insurmountable crisis.</li><li>If you have children, it is important for parents or guardians to appear calm and confident, since children may feel anxious or fearful about their family&rsquo;s or their own personal health.</li><li><strong>Develop realistic goals and take decisive action.</strong> By having a plan, you can focus on specific tasks that will enable you to move towards your goal. This might include ensuring you have a supply of food, water, flu-related medicines or activities that you and your family can do at home if you become isolated. By keeping yourself busy, your mind will be occupied, having less time to dwell on worries and fears.</li><li><strong>Control stress by managing your worries.</strong> Intense worrying about what might happen or how the situation with ill family members might get worse can trigger our body&rsquo;s automatic &ldquo;fight-flight&rdquo; stress response. Over time, this physical response to stress takes its toll on our bodies. Consider finding effective ways of managing stress, such as:</li><ul><li><strong>Quarantine the worry.</strong> Create a regular half hour each day as "worry time" to identify and tackle each worry as if it were a problem to solve. When you feel yourself slipping into a worried frame of mind, try to postpone the feelings and focus instead on what is actually happening at that moment.</li><li><strong>Find a quiet place each day where you can write down your worries and fears undisturbed.</strong> Sometimes by articulating your worries, it is easier to find solutions or simply deal with them. Periodically, collect what you&rsquo;ve written, read through it and destroy it as a symbolic way of acknowledging that you&rsquo;ve dealt with those worries.</li></ul><li><strong>Learn from your past. </strong>Think back to past experiences and sources of personal strength that helped you through other crisis situations. For example, how have you typically responded to stressful events? Who did you turn to for support? How did you overcome the situation? What did you learn that would be helpful in this situation?</li><li><strong>Stay connected.</strong> The fear of infection and the desire to protect yourself and your family from the flu may mean avoiding social situations and increased isolation. However you can still maintain contact with people, by phone, letter or email. Also be sure to regularly gather up-to-date information on the pandemic from a reliable source. </li><li><strong>Keep physically fit.</strong> During a pandemic, you may not be able to enjoy your usual level of physical activity. However, it is important to exercise your body and stretch out tense muscles as well as finding time for relaxation. Eat a healthy diet and be sure to get enough sleep. By taking care of yourself, you will be better prepared to deal with situations that require resilience. </li><li><strong>Reach out for professional assistance.</strong> If intense anxiety is preventing you from performing your job or other daily activities, consider contacting a professional for counselling support. </li></ul><p>A professional can provide you with the knowledge, guidance and peace of mind on how to cope during a pandemic to ensure you and your loved ones stay healthy and safe. Being well informed and putting to rest any fears can put you in a good position to protect yourself should one occur.</p>',

            '<p>Whether you&rsquo;re working or retired, an interruption in your income can cause stress and hardship. Fortunately, there are measures you can take to cope with the financial stress resulting from a layoff, furlough, strike, disability, or interruption in entitlement payments, and reduce the difficulties and anxiety associated with lost income.</p><p><strong>When your income is interrupted</strong></p><p>Interruptions in income can arise from a variety of personal or work-related circumstances, including emergencies and unexpected events. You may experience an interruption in your income due to:</p><p><strong>A natural disaster, crisis, or other unexpected event.</strong> All can temporarily affect your income and ability to work.</p><p><strong>Furloughs.</strong> A furlough is time off from work without pay, often with the continuation of some or all benefits. When an employer imposes an involuntary furlough it is usually in an effort to avoid layoffs&mdash;spreading the pain of income loss among a set of employees but making each worker&rsquo;s loss of income relatively small. Keep in mind that a reduction in your gross income also affects how much tax is taken out of your paycheck. Consider speaking with a financial adviser if your furlough time will add up to more than a few weeks out of the year. See the article &ldquo;<u>When You Are Being Furloughed from Your Job</u>&rdquo; on this website for more information.</p><p><strong>Interruption in entitlement payments, such as Old Age Security.</strong> Cuts in federal programs or changes in how the government measures inflation may affect Income Assistance benefits, long-term unemployment benefits, and other services.</p><p><strong>Layoffs</strong><em>.</em> If your income has been interrupted due to a layoff, you may be able to file an unemployment claim. Each province or territory has its own process for workers to file unemployment claims. Much or all of the process can now be accomplished online. If you are filing an unemployment claim, be aware that administrators may expect you to be actively looking for another job, so be prepared to periodically submit documentation of your job search.</p><p><strong>Strike.</strong> While going on strike means giving up your pay cheque for a time, a union may have a program to compensate workers for some of their lost wages and resources to help workers cope during the work stoppage.</p><p><strong>Disability. </strong>An on-the-job injury may entitle you to workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. A medical condition that prevents you from working may entitle you to disability benefits available through an employer or administered through the <a href="http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/information/wcb_canada.html">Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety</a>.</p><p><strong>Strategies to help you get through</strong></p><p>New spending habits, adjusting your budget, and strategizing to make ends meet during the time your income is interrupted will help you get through this stressful time. The sooner you adjust to these necessities the more control you will have over your money. Here are immediate steps to take:</p><p><strong>Adjust your budget.</strong> If you have a personal or family budget, revise it to account for the reduced income. If you don&rsquo;t, now is the time to create one. You&rsquo;ll find a helpful worksheet on this website to help you get started. See &ldquo;<u>Setting Up a Personal or Household Budget Worksheet</u>.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>If you are eligible for unemployment benefits, apply immediately.</strong> It may take several weeks for your cheques to start arriving.</p><p><strong>Cut back on unnecessary spending.</strong> Restaurant meals, entertainment outside the home, expensive gifts, and premium cable are just a few of the kinds of expenses to consider reducing.</p><p><strong>Look for ways to cut costs on big-ticket items.</strong> Almost any item on your budget has savings potential. Could you drive a smaller, more economical car? Find less expensive insurance, or a less expensive phone plan? Could you share child care with a relative or friend&mdash;or, if one parent is now home, temporarily eliminate child care? You may even consider relocating to a smaller home or less expensive neighbourhood.</p><p><strong>Avoid going into credit card debt.</strong> It&rsquo;s better to cut your expenses than to go into debt by overusing credit cards, with their high interest charges. If you must use credit cards, never exceed your credit limit, always make monthly payments on time to avoid fees, and have a plan for paying off credit card debt as quickly as possible. Better yet, don&rsquo;t use credit cards at all; instead, use a debit card, which draws directly from your bank account.</p><p><strong>Consider carefully before dipping into your RRSP.</strong> Borrowing from your RRSP can seem like an appealing option if you must come up with more cash quickly, but consider the disadvantages as well as the advantages. It&rsquo;s your own money, so you can&rsquo;t be denied this kind of loan. However, you&rsquo;ll miss out on any market gains that money would have made; you&rsquo;ll need to repay the loan with after-tax money, If you&rsquo;re taking money out of your RRSP before you retire, you&rsquo;re immediately going to pay a withholding tax. If you take up to $5,000, you&rsquo;re going to pay 10%. If it&rsquo;s between $5,000 and $15,000, they hold back 20% and if it&rsquo;s more than $15,000, they hold back 30%. You also have to report that money as taxable income and you may have to pay even more at tax time.</p><p><strong>Find ways to earn additional income.</strong> Telemarketing, child care, cooking, teaching, coaching, election work, census work, selling unneeded possessions, and renting extra space are just some of the ways you may be able to earn extra income. Just be careful not to sign contracts that you may not want or be able to fulfill.</p><p><strong>Consider family resources.</strong> Family members who live nearby can sometimes help you reduce expenses, for example by helping with child care. Before accepting a loan from a family member, however, consider carefully the expectations for repayment as well as your personal relationships. Remember that an income interruption is a temporary setback, but family is family forever.</p><p><strong>If you need help meeting expenses</strong></p><p><strong>To find resources that can help you meet specific expenses</strong><em>, </em>visit <a href="http://www.unitedway.ca/how-we-help/">United Way Canada</a><em>, </em>or dial 211 from any Canadian telephone line to reach a service that will connect you with community and social resources close to your area.</p><p><strong>For help with housing-related expenses,</strong> visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/housing.html">Canada.ca</a> for a wide range of information and resources.</p><p><strong>For counselling on managing debt</strong><em>, contact </em><a href="http://creditcounsellingcanada.ca/">Credit Counselling Canada</a><em>.</em> They can help you combine debts (such as credit card balances) into a single balance with more manageable payments.</p><p><strong>Look into mortgage refinancing and foreclosure assistance programs.</strong> These may be available from your province or territory or local government. You can also visit banks directly to find out about their mortgage refinancing offerings.</p><p><strong>Get assistance with utility bills.</strong> Help with expenses like electricity and heating may be available from province or territory and local governments or the utilities themselves.</p><p><strong>Take advantage of the GST/HST credit.</strong> You&rsquo;re entitled to this tax break if your income falls within certain limits.

The service is available in most parts of Canada. and can be reached by dialing 211. An internet search is another good way to find such resources in your area.</p><p>Interruptions in income can be very distressing. But remember that you are far from alone&mdash;people everywhere are finding ways to get through the same difficulties you are facing now. And setbacks are generally temporary: either your work will pick up again or you will find a new way to move forward.</p>',

            '<p>A 2010 study by the American Psychological Association found that an overwhelming 76 percent of Americans consider money to be a significant source of stress. And while the economy and markets seem a little more stable in Canada, these are still economically challenging times globally. When the stress of an uncertain economy starts to become overwhelming, far more is at stake than just money. Stress is a direct or indirect cause of many serious health conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease and depression. Financial concerns can also place an uncomfortable strain on family relationships.</p><p>Balancing Your Emotions and Finances</p><p>While market fluctuations and occasional losses are inevitable, there are steps you can take to safeguard your investments and rest a little easier in turbulent times:</p><p><strong>Seek sound advice</strong>. If you&rsquo;re feeling anxious about your investments, a conversation with a trusted financial advisor is always the best place to start. While there&rsquo;s no shortage of general advice, the right investment strategy is never one-size-fits-all. It&rsquo;s important to regularly review your investments and adapt to changes in your personal situation, goals, and risk tolerance. An updated long-term investment plan backed by solid expert recommendations can go a long way towards putting your mind at ease.</p><p><strong>Facts over fear</strong>. When your investments start to lose value, it&rsquo;s easy to allow emotions to cloud your judgement. Take a step back and gather as much accurate, factual information as possible. For example, if a stock you own has been fluctuating recently, take a careful look at the actual corporation behind it. If you see an organization with a strong balance sheet, consistent earnings, competent management, and a solid reputation, chances are good that any short-term volatility won&rsquo;t have too great an effect on the long-term value of the company. A solid understanding of the facts can help you make calm, rational decisions about your finances.</p><p><strong>Stay invested</strong>: In a difficult economy, it can be tempting to cash out your investments and move your money to a guaranteed savings account (or hide it under your mattress!). Taking an overly- defensive approach, however, can lead you to miss the opportunity to recover losses when the economy turns and investment values begin to rise. As well, if your returns are too low, the real value of your assets will drop as your savings won&rsquo;t keep up with inflation. While you may consider rebalancing your portfolio to avoid unnecessary risk, pulling out of the market entirely is rarely the best course of action.</p><p><strong>Focus long-term</strong>. Unless you&rsquo;re ready to retire, long-term investment performance is likely going to be far more important than any daily, weekly or even quarterly returns. While things may seem bleak today, history shows that markets have always rebounded and conservative investors are usually able to recover at least partial losses. For example, the average U.S. recession over last 50 years has lasted only 11 months. Take a long-range view of your investments and accept that short-term fluctuation is par for the course.</p><p><strong>Turn down the noise</strong>: Today&rsquo;s investors are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information. In turbulent times, much of this commentary can take the form of negative &lsquo;doomsday&rsquo; predictions which do little more than create unnecessary anxiety. While it&rsquo;s important to regularly monitor the performance of your investments, there&rsquo;s little to be gained by compulsively checking daily stock prices or reading every available financial article. Listen to only the information you need to make informed decisions and tune out the rest.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget debt</strong>: Many investors overlook the fact that paying down personal debts may actually offer an equal or greater return than what the market can provide, especially in a difficult economy. For example, paying off the balance on a credit card costing you 19 per cent annual interest will give you the savings equivalent of earning a 19 per cent return. If you&rsquo;re in a position to do so, paying down debt can also improve your credit scores and free-up available credit for emergencies &ndash; both of which can help you breathe a little easier in uncertain times.</p><p><strong>Release tension</strong>. Market stresses can take a powerful toll on your mental and physical health, as well as your personal relationships. Look for healthy ways to relieve tension and take your mind off the markets. Exercise is among the most powerful stress relievers, but hobbies, entertainment, and social time with family and friends can also be effective. At the end of the day, no amount of money is worth sacrificing your well-being.</p><p>Without a crystal ball, none of us can predict where the markets will be tomorrow. But with an educated strategy, regular review and a positive, long-term outlook, you can maximize your chances of strong returns&mdash;and a healthy, happy retirement.</p>',

            "<p>A financial planner helps clients make choices about what to do with their money, property, and other assets. Most financial planners are experts in certain areas but they should all be able to help with life insurance, investing, school savings, retirement plans, tax implications, and estate planning. </p><p><strong>Do I need a financial planner? </strong></p><p>Almost everyone needs some sort of financial planning. Yet many people find it all too easy to put off planning for years, even up to retirement—when they suddenly find there isn't enough money. You might know your financial goals, such as buying a new home or paying for your child's college education, but you may not know how best to meet those goals. A financial planner can help with the following: </p><ul><li>planning for taxes </li><li>planning for private school or post-secondary education </li><li>managing your insurance </li><li>planning your retirement </li><li>planning your estate </li></ul><ul><li>planning your investments </li></ul><p>In addition to a written financial plan, a planner may offer other services such as income tax preparation, investment management, and insurance sales. Depending on your financial situation, you may need a financial planner to advise you not only in setting your financial goals but also in helping you put your plan into action. </p><p><strong>Working together on your financial plan </strong></p><p>A planner will work with you to examine your current financial situation and suggest a plan to help you meet your financial goals. The planner might set up a series of meetings with you to gather information, help you define your goals, and provide written recommendations on financial strategies. It's important to find a financial planner whose expertise matches your situation and needs. Before you begin working together, you'll want to understand what it will cost—both directly, in fees, and indirectly, in commissions—before you begin working with a financial planner. </p><p>When working together, a financial planner will take you through several steps to help you do the following: </p><p><strong>Clarify your financial situation.</strong> A financial planner will help you look carefully at your current finances, helping you to list your assets (what you have) and liabilities (what you owe). Your planner will most likely ask you for tax returns, securities records (i.e. stocks and bonds), insurance policies, and other papers to help determine your net worth (what you have minus what you owe). </p><p><strong>Identify goals. </strong>Next, the planner will want to understand your personal and financial goals. Questions will include whether you want to save for a special vacation, help support aging parents, reduce your debt, plan for a child's education, or save and invest for retirement. </p><p><strong>Identify roadblocks. </strong>After understanding your goals, the planner will work with you to figure out what roadblocks might keep you from meeting your goals. These might include investments that don't provide sufficient yield; lack of insurance to protect your home, savings, or income; or spending habits that are pushing you into debt. </p><p><strong>Create a plan.</strong> The planner will create a written plan outlining how you can meet your goals. The plan will include types of investments and insurance products, suggestions for budgeting, and a timeframe for achieving short- and long-term goals. </p><p><strong>Implement the plan. </strong>You may implement the plan yourself or have the planner help you choose and purchase appropriate investment and insurance products. </p><p>It's a good idea to meet with your planner at least once a year to review your progress toward your goals and revise the plan accordingly. You should also talk with your planner whenever your personal or economic situation changes, for example, due to marriage, divorce, having children, health changes, an inheritance, unanticipated major changes in income or expenses, or a change in your financial goals. </p>",

            '<p>A positive attitude or optimistic outlook doesn’t just make you feel better. It can strengthen your relationships with friends, family, and co-workers and make it easier to deal with everything from a bad day at work to a major life change. A positive outlook isn’t just something that you’re born with—it’s a skill that you can learn. Here are some tips:</p><p><strong>Practice talking back to yourself. </strong>Try to turn your negative thoughts into positive ones. Instead of thinking, “I’ll never make it to the end of my shift,” say, “I can do this. And at the end of the day, I’ll go for a long walk to reward myself for getting through this crunch.” When you have a problem, tell yourself, “I’ll find one small thing I can do that will help. Things are going to get better.”</p><p><strong>Spend time with optimistic people. </strong>Moods can be contagious, and negative thinking spreads quickly, especially at work. If you spend time with people who have a positive outlook, you may start thinking more positively, too.</p><p><strong>Keep learning and growing. </strong>Learning new things—whether it’s how to fish or use a new software program—gives you confidence. Try something new whenever you can, and avoid thoughts that begin with, “I’m too old to . . .” or “I don’t have enough time to . . .”</p><p><strong>Make time for the things that make you happy. </strong>Whether it’s spending time with friends, going to the movies, listening to music you love, or just playing with your kids or dog, make the activities you love to do a priority.</p><p><strong>Bring more humour into your life. </strong>A sense of humour is a great stress-buster. Spend time with fun people, share jokes with friends on social media, or watch funny movies at home.</p><p><strong>Get moving.</strong> Moderate-to-vigorous exercise triggers the release of endorphins, natural feel-good chemicals in the brain. Getting your endorphins going can lead to an overall positive feeling in your body that your attitude will reflect.</p><p><strong>Have things to look forward to, </strong>whether it’s a weekend get-together with family, going to the gym after a tough day at work, or calling a friend you haven’t talked to in a while.</p><p><strong>Practice gratitude. </strong>Spend a few minutes each day reflecting on the good things in your life or sharing them with a friend or relative. Try keeping a gratitude journal.</p>',

            '<p>The recent outbreak of COVID-19, which may be commonly known as “coronavirus” or “Wuhan coronavirus,” has now been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to the death toll and the spread of the virus overseas.</p><p>The first cases appeared in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province in China, in December 2019. There have been confirmed cases in many other countries. For more information about affected regions, click <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd">here</a>.</p><p><strong>What is COVID-19?</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 is a virus that falls under the coronavirus “family” of respiratory viruses. It can cause breathing difficulties in those who have contracted it. Experts believe that it probably originated from human contact with animals, as these types of viruses are found most often in animals. In the case of the COVID-19, expert believe that it the outbreak may have spread due do illegal trading of exotic animals.</p><p><strong>What are the symptoms?</strong></p><p>The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of a cold of flu: fever, headache, dry cough, and body aches with the added symptom of breathing problems. The incubation period during which a person has the disease but is not exhibiting symptoms can be between one day and two weeks. It’s possible that the virus can be passed on to others during the incubation period before the person carrying starts to exhibit symptoms.</p><p>It’s important to seek medical treatment if you think you might have contracted COVID-19.</p><p><strong>How can I avoid getting COVID-19?</strong></p><p>The only way to get COVID-19 is to be in close physical contact with a person or animal that has contracted the virus. Because those who have been infected might not show symptoms for up to two weeks, it’s important to remain vigilant.</p><p>To best avoid catching COVID-19, the WHO recommends practicing good hand hygiene (washing hands with soap and water) and respiratory hygiene (sneezing into your elbow instead of your hand), and avoiding any unnecessary physical contact with wild animals. Practice “physical distancing”—maintain at least a metre (3 feet) of distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, as these are the easiest way for viruses to enter your system. If you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care immediately.</p><p>There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</strong></p><p>No. COVID-19 and SARS come from the same group of viruses, called coronaviruses. There can be some confusion here, as many people refer to COVID-19 as simply “coronavirus”—but COVID-19 is not the same virus as SARS. It’s also believed that because of the SARS outbreak of 2003, China is better-equipped to handle this virus outbreak.</p><p><strong>Where can I find out more information?</strong></p><p>WHO releases daily <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">reports</a> on the effects of COVID-19. </p><p>You can also find out more information from the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus.html">Health Canada website</a>.</p>',

            '<p>The recent outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 has a lot of people self-isolating. While necessary to curb the spread of the disease, self-isolation can lead to people feeling cut off from society, like they&rsquo;ve lost their routine, or are being forced to take time out from important relationships.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re self-isolating, you&rsquo;re not alone; thousands of people are taking this important measure. This article will show you ways that you can combat loneliness while following self-isolation rules.</p><p><strong>Self-isolation vs. physical distancing</strong></p><p>Self-isolation is a precautionary measure that&rsquo;s meant to benefit society by removing carriers and potential carriers of COVID-19 from the general population in order to protect the safety of the most vulnerable. It means removing yourself from the general population by staying at home for a recommended number of days. You may need assistance with things like grocery shopping and pharmacy runs.</p><p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html">Health Canada</a> has up to date guidelines about who should be self-isolating. Please refer to them for more information.  check with your local health authority for more information on who should be self-isolating.</p><p>You might have also heard the term &ldquo;physical distancing.&rdquo; This is when someone tries to avoid contact with other people even though they have not been exposed to COVID-19. Physical distancing means:</p><ul><li>staying at home whenever possible</li><li>working from home if that&rsquo;s an option for you</li><li>avoiding crowded public places such as shops, bars, restaurants, and gyms</li><li>avoiding public transit where large groups of people are brought together such as buses, trains, and planes</li><li>limiting contact with people known to have been travelling, or have contracted or have come into contact with someone who has contracted COVID-19</li></ul><p>By choosing to practice physical distancing, someone is actively trying to limit the spread of the virus.</p><p><strong>Loneliness and self-isolation</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that self-isolation and all the actions it requires might lead to loneliness. Even if you have a partner, children, or roommates self-isolating with you, it&rsquo;s natural to miss the routine that seeing other people brings.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re in self-isolation, it might help to remind yourself that you&rsquo;re not just doing it for your benefit&mdash;you&rsquo;re doing it to ensure that those who are more vulnerable (people who are immuno-compromised, elderly, or already sick) aren&rsquo;t at risk.</p><p>Other things that may help alleviate feelings of loneliness include:</p><p><strong>Connect with family and friends. </strong>Arrange for phone or video calls with loved ones, even if it&rsquo;s just to check in. You might find that other people are sharing your worries, and connecting can be a great way to see you&rsquo;re not alone.</p><p><strong>Pick a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; project and finish it. </strong>If you&rsquo;re stuck inside, you might find that you have too much free time. Why not pick up that book you&rsquo;ve been meaning to finish, that instrument you&rsquo;ve been meaning to learn how to play, or that recipe you&rsquo;ve been itching to try? If you&rsquo;re struggling, look to social media like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, to connect with other people who share your interests.</p><p><strong>Look into community resources available to you. </strong>Nextdoor, the social media platform that connects neighbours, can be a great resource if you need help with errands, groceries deliveries, and packages that need to be picked up. (Be sure to follow guidelines for safety to avoid scams or protect yourself.) Also, you may want to take advantage of grocery and takeout delivery and services are now offering &ldquo;no contact&rdquo; options.</p><p><strong>Find creative ways to get exercise. </strong>Are you spending all day in your pajamas? Do you have an established routine? Sometimes, feeling like you&rsquo;re all alone can come from a sense of purposelessness. The best way to not get lethargic when you&rsquo;re at home is to have some goals in mind throughout the day, including exercise. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be complicated: if you don&rsquo;t have a running or spin machine at home, you can still do push-ups and sit-ups. Search YouTube for an at-home workout that doesn&rsquo;t require weights if you&rsquo;re unsure where to start!</p><p><strong>If you are able to go outside without breaking the rules of your self-isolation, get some fresh air. </strong>This can be tricky, but if you can have a cup of tea in a garden or on a balcony, it will help negate the feeling that you&rsquo;re stuck at home. Even if you don&rsquo;t have outdoor space at your home, try opening the windows to let in fresh air.</p><p><strong>Connect with your assistance program. </strong>Trained counsellors are always available to talk about issues of stress, worry, isolation, and fears about the future. Get in touch with your assistance program if COVID-19 is causing you stress or anxiety</p>',
